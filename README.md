YOLOv10m Object Detection Project with Roboflow and YOLOv8 Conversion
Overview
This project is a demonstration of my ability to implement object detection using the YOLOv10m model. I utilized Roboflow to curate and prepare a dataset, applied various augmentation techniques, and converted the dataset to YOLOv8 format to ensure compatibility. My focus was on training and evaluating the model with and without augmentations to analyze their impact. The final implementation was modified to align with Matrice BYOM guidelines for seamless integration.

Key Steps
1. Dataset Preparation
I downloaded Rice Image Dataset from Kaggle
I started by creating a dataset on Roboflow that included 5 object categories, with 100 images per category. The dataset was split as follows:

Training: 70%
Validation: 20%
Testing: 10%
After preparation, I exported the dataset in YOLOv8 format, which ensured compatibility with modern YOLO frameworks.

2. Data Augmentation
These augmentations included:

Horizontal and vertical flips
Brightness and contrast adjustments
Random cropping
Noise injection
Scaling and rotation
I visualized these transformations on sample images to ensure their effectiveness. Automating these steps allowed me to integrate augmentations into the training pipeline efficiently.

3. Hash-Based Model Selection
Using my hash value of 42, I selected YOLOv10m from the ranked list on Papers with Code. This selection aligned with the project requirements and was an ideal choice for the dataset.

4. Training the Model
Pre-trained Weights: I initialized the model using MSCOCO checkpoints.
Training Setup: I trained the model twice:
Without augmentations (baseline performance).
With augmentations (enhanced dataset).
Evaluation Metrics: I used COCO metrics  to measure performance. The augmented model outperformed the baseline, showing better generalization and improved detection accuracy.
5. Integration with Matrice BYOM Platform
To meet the requirements of the Matrice BYOM platform, I modified the YOLOv10m repository:

Added augmentation parameters to the training configuration file, allowing flexibility in applying transformations during training.
Embedded the augmentation pipeline to ensure compatibility with the platform's requirements.
6. Code Implementation
My code was designed for clarity and modularity:

Data Augmentation: I wrote a Python script (dataset_utils.py) to automate the augmentation process. This script included a function, apply_augmentations, that applied transformations like flips, rotations, and color adjustments. Visualizations confirmed the correctness of these augmentations.
Training Pipeline: The training script loaded MSCOCO pre-trained weights and included configurations for learning rate, batch size, and augmentation strategies. I also generated predictions on test data to visualize the model’s performance.
Integration Modifications: The training configuration file was updated to dynamically apply multiple augmentation settings during training, ensuring the model aligned with Matrice's platform guidelines.
Results and Analysis
Without Augmentation: The model performed moderately well but struggled with certain variations in data.
With Augmentation: The augmented dataset significantly improved the model’s performance, leading to higher precision and recall scores.
The predictions on test data visually showcased the model’s ability to detect objects under diverse conditions after augmentation.

Tools and Frameworks
Roboflow: For dataset preparation, splitting, and YOLOv8 format conversion.
YOLOv10m Framework: Used for training and inference.
PyLint: I ensured my code adhered to Python best practices and achieved a perfect 10/10 score.

My Experience
This project was a valuable learning experience. Implementing and automating augmentations allowed me to explore how data diversity improves model performance. The integration process with Matrice’s platform deepened my understanding of model deployment and compatibility. Overall, I gained insights into the importance of data preprocessing and its impact on real-world applications of object detection.
